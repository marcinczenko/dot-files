## Staying in sync with upstream

You can follow the steps described in [Syncing a
fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/). We recommend that you
keep your local master branch pointing to the upstream master branch. Remaining
in sync then becomes really easy:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy.git
git fetch upstream
git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/master master
```

Now, when you do `git pull` from your local `master` branch git will 
fetch changes from the `upstream` remote. Then you can make all of 
your pull request branches based on this `master` branch.
