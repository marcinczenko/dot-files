# originally this was used to make sure that the laptop screen goes
# off when lid is closed and an external display is present.
# For this, the script could be something like this:

# if hyprctl monitors | grep -q 'DP-1'; then
#   if [[ "$1" == "close" ]]; then
#     hyprctl dispatch dpms off
#     hyprctl keyword monitor "eDP-1, disable"
#   elif [[ "$1" == "open" ]]; then
#     hyprctl dispatch dpms on
#     hyprctl keyword monitor "eDP-1, 2880x1920@120.00Hz, 0x0, 2"
#   fi
